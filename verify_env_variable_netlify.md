Hi there!

Let's ensure your `REACT_APP_BASE_URL` environment variable is correctly set up in your Netlify deployment environment. This is a critical step for your deployed application to communicate with your backend API.

As we can see in your `frontend/src/config/api.js` file, the `BASE_URL` for your API calls is determined by `process.env.REACT_APP_BASE_URL`. If this variable isn't found in the environment, it defaults to `http://localhost:5000`:

```javascript
// Базовый URL API
export const BASE_URL = process.env.REACT_APP_BASE_URL || 'http://localhost:5000';
```

While `http://localhost:5000` is perfectly fine for local development, it will **not** work once your site is deployed on Netlify. Your live frontend needs to point to your live backend URL.

**Here's how to verify and set it in Netlify:**

1.  **Log in to Netlify:** Go to [app.netlify.com](https://app.netlify.com).
2.  **Select your site:** From the list of your sites, click on the one you're working on.
3.  **Navigate to Environment Variables:**
    *   Go to **Site overview** (or it might be called **Site settings** or **Deploys** depending on recent UI updates - look for a settings or configuration area).
    *   Find the section for **Build & deploy**.
    *   Click on **Environment** (or **Environment variables**).
4.  **Check for `REACT_APP_BASE_URL`:**
    *   In the list of environment variables, look for `REACT_APP_BASE_URL`.
    *   **If it's there:** Ensure its value is set to your **live backend API URL** (e.g., `https://your-api.yourdomain.com` or `https://your-backend-service-name.onrender.com`). It should **NOT** be `http://localhost:5000`.
    *   **If it's NOT there:** You need to add it.
        *   Click on "Add a variable" or "New variable" (or a similar button).
        *   For the **Key**, enter `REACT_APP_BASE_URL`.
        *   For the **Value**, enter your **live backend API URL**.
5.  **Redeploy (if necessary):** If you've added or changed the value of `REACT_APP_BASE_URL`, Netlify usually requires a new deploy for the changes to take effect. You can typically trigger a new deploy from the "Deploys" tab by selecting "Trigger deploy" and choosing "Deploy site."

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Correct URL:** Double-check that the URL you provide for your live backend is accurate. Any typos will prevent your frontend from reaching the API.
*   **HTTPS:** If your live backend is served over HTTPS (which it should be!), make sure the URL starts with `https://`.
*   **No Trailing Slash (Usually):** While some APIs might be lenient, it's generally good practice to provide the base URL without a trailing slash (e.g., `https://api.example.com` rather than `https://api.example.com/`). Your `axios` configuration in `api.js` will handle appending the specific endpoint paths.

By ensuring `REACT_APP_BASE_URL` is correctly configured in Netlify, you'll allow your deployed React application to successfully make API calls to your backend.
